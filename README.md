============
This folder contains some Python codes which were used in my "Computational study of gene and motif complexes of different cell types" project, developed at the University of Warsaw, Poland. There are other scripts and files, which are not shared here. The idea of this project was to compare the predicted behavior of human and mouse motif dimers (by TACO) with real behavior observed in the lab.
