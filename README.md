============
This folder contains some Python codes which were used in my "Computational study of gene and motif complexes of different cell types" project, developed at the University of Warsaw, Poland. There were other scripts and files developed by myself, which cannot be shared in public. The idea of this project was to compare the predicted behavior (by TACO) of motif dimers with real motif dimers observed in the lab.

These files are uploaded for the purpose to elaborate my Python scripting techniques.
